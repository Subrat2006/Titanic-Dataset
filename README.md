# Titanic Dataset
This is a dataset available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com).

You all can access the Dataset in CSV format at the site. [Click here](https://www.kaggle.com/heptapod/titanic) to directly go to the Dataset.

The dataset is available in the files section of this repository too! Don't forget to keep the .ipynb file and .csv file in same folder.
## Requirements:
The requirement for this Project is just a system (with any OS), with [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), and Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter-Lab must be installed in it.

*You can also use VS Code or any other platform for Jupyter*

## Installing the Jupyter Notebook:
You can install [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install.html) in 2 ways. They are as follows:

### Installing the Classic Jupyter Notebook:-
If you are using ```Windows```, then use the following command in your Command Prompt or Windows Powershell:
```
pip install jupyter notebook
```
For ```Anaconda``` users, type the following command in your Anaconda Prompt:
```
conda install jupyter notebook
```
*The Anaconda users needn't install the Classic Jupyter Notebook as Jupyter Notebook comes pre-installed with the Anaconda Packages.*

For ```Mamba``` users, type this command:
```
mamba install jupyter notebook
```



### Installing the Jupyter-Lab:- 
If you are using ```Windows```, then use the following command in your Command Prompt or Windows Powershell:
```
pip install jupyterlab
```
For ```Anaconda``` users, type the following command in your Anaconda Prompt:
```
conda install jupyterlab
```

For ```Mamba``` users, type this command:
```
mamba install jupyterlab
```

##Installing and importing Modules:
We would be using Pandas for cleaning the data and processing it.

You can install Pandas by the following command:
```
pip install pandas
```

For importing the modules, use the following command in your notebook:
```
import pandas as pd
```

You can import a dataset into any variable, say df, by the following command:
```
df = pd.read_csv("Name of the CSV file.csv)
```
NOTE:- The dataset should be in CSV Format. For excel, you can use ```pd.read_excel``` command. Just for importing excel, you would have to install some more packages that would be mentioned in the notebook.


*I have written pd here because we have imported the pandas module in the name of pd*

## Further readings:
[Click here](https://jupyter.org/install.html) if you want to know more about the installation of Jupyter Notebook.

You can use the [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com), is you want an alternative to Jupyter Notebook.

For Jupyter Notebook, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) is also a good alternative.
